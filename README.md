## FRONTEND

This provides an overview of the frontend components of the Voting Application developed using Jetpack Compose with Kotlin. The application includes several screens, each serving a specific purpose, such as user authentication, home page, admin panel, and result page.

### DEPENDENCIES USED

The frontend application utilizes various additional dependencies for enhanced functionality:

- Navigation: **`androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:2.7.7`**
- View Model: **`androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose:2.7.0`**
- Lottie Animation: **`com.airbnb.android:lottie-compose:4.0.0`**
- Retrofit for Networking:
    
    **`com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0`**, **`com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0`**, **`com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.11.0`**, **`com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.10.0`**
    
- Confetti Animation: **`nl.dionsegijn:konfetti-compose:2.0.4`**

### SCREENS AND VIEWMODELS
